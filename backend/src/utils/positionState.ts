// backend/src/utils/positionState.ts
//
// ONE definition of "is this position still open?", shared by everything that
// counts, lists, monitors or liquidates positions.
//
// Why it isn't just `netSol > dust`: netSol is (SOL spent buying) minus (SOL
// received selling), i.e. the position's remaining COST, not what's held.
//   - closed at a PROFIT  -> netSol goes negative (fine, reads as closed)
//   - closed at a LOSS    -> netSol stays positive forever (the loss)
// so a position that was fully sold at a loss looked open indefinitely. It was
// counted against Max Open Positions, listed on the dashboard (with a price
// lookup per refresh), re-checked by the monitor every 5 seconds, and offered
// for sale by "Sell All & Stop" — with nothing left to sell. The reliable
// signal is the position's own remainingPct, which the monitor sets to 0 on a
// final exit; it is 100 when bought and drops with each partial sale.
