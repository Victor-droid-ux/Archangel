// ONE backend origin drives everything: NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL, which the
// rest of the app (lib/utils.ts's fetcher, lib/socket.ts) already reads.
// API_BASE_URL and SOCKET_URL used to have their own variables with
// localhost fallbacks, so a production build that set only
// NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL sent every settings request to the visitor's own
// localhost:4000 and none of them worked. Both are now derived from it;
// NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL / NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL still override if set.
// (NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are inlined at BUILD time — rebuild after changing.)

  SOCKET_URL: stripTrailingSlashes(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL || BACKEND_URL
  ), // backend socket server
  // Must match the env var names WalletProvider.tsx/useWallet.ts actually
  // read (NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_ENDPOINT, with _RPC_URL as a legacy alias) —
  // this used to check NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC (no _URL), which nothing sets,
  // so it always silently fell through to the public rate-limited endpoint.

// DEFAULT_CONFIG and API_ROUTES used to live here — removed. Neither was
// imported anywhere (useConfig.ts's useTradingConfigStore is the real
// source of trading defaults, and every API call goes through fetcher()/
// ENV.API_BASE_URL directly), and both had drifted from reality: DEFAULT_CONFIG's
// values (slippage 1.5%, stop-loss 5%) disagreed with the store's real
// defaults (1%, 2%), and API_ROUTES only listed 4 of the many endpoints
// that exist now. Dead constants that also happen to be wrong are worse
// than no constants — remove rather than leave as a landmine for whoever
// finds them next and assumes they're current.
